**Q1. What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?**

> The set of protocols used in a communications network. A protocol stack is a prescribed hierarchy of software layers, starting from the application layer at the top (the source of the data being sent) to the data link layer at the bottom (transmitting the bits on the wire). The stack resides in each client and server, and the layered approach lets different protocols be swapped in and out to accommodate different network architectures.

**Q2.What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?**

> A **server** is a software or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests made over a network. The device that makes the request, and receives a response from the server, is called a client. On the Internet, the term "server" commonly refers to the computer system that receives requests for a web files and sends those files to the client.

> Servers are often categorized in terms of their purpose. A few examples of the types of servers available are as follows:

- **Web server**: a computer program that serves requested HTML pages or files. In this case, a web browser acts as the client.
- **Application server**: a program in a computer in a distributed network that provides the business logic for an application program.
- **Proxy server**: software that acts as an intermediary between an endpoint device, such as a computer, and another server from which a user or client is requesting a service.
- **Mail server**: an application that receives incoming emails from local users -- people within the same domain -- and remote senders and forwards outgoing emails for delivery.
- **Virtual server**: a program running on a shared server that is configured in such a way that it seems to each user that they have complete control of a server.
- **Blade server**: a server chassis housing multiple thin, modular electronic circuit boards, known as server blades. Each blade is a server in its own right, often dedicated to a single application
- **File server**: a computer responsible for the central storage and management of data files so that other computers on the same network can access them.
- **Policy server**: a security component of a policy-based network that provides authorization services and facilitates tracking and control of files.
- **Database server**: this server is responsible for hosting one or more databases. Client applications perform database queries that retrieve data from or write data to the database that is hosted on the server.
- **Print server**: this server provides users with access to one or more network-attached printers -- or print devices as some server vendors call them. The print server acts as a queue for the print jobs that users submit. Some print servers can prioritize the jobs in the print queue based on the job type or on who submitted the print job.

**Q4. What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?**

> **Server scaling** describes adjusting the computing power of servers, usually to increase power by “scaling up”. This can be done either by scaling vertically or horizontally. **Vertical scaling** involves replacing the server with a larger, more powerful one. **Horizontal scaling** (sometimes called “scaling out”) means adding several servers and combining their totaled computing power.

**Here are ways to optimise your website for better search engine rankings.**

**1.Target The Right Keywords**
Keywords are phrases or words that explain what your website content is all about. They are the words or phrases that prospective customers will type into Google to find the products or services you offer.

The relationship between keywords and website optimisation is pretty simple. Google (and other search engines) will send their bots to visit your website, read and index your content, score the relevancy of your keywords and then rank your website in the SERPs accordingly.

**2.Create New Content**
Creating new content is necessary to build a loyal base of customers and followers. Remember, there are other competitive websites offering similar products. You need to stand out and be perceived as a thought leader within your industry.

Ensure the content on your website is updated frequently. Make it interesting and engaging to your followers to build loyalty.

Also, Google and other search engines tend to reward websites that publish new, high-quality content. To rank highly in the SERPS, it is best practice to regularly update your website content.

Make sure to include your target keywords within the content. But don’t overdo it, just write naturally.

**3. Optimise Your META Tags**
META tags are bits of HTML code in the header of a webpage. They are vital for SEO. They help search engines understand the content of the webpage.

The main ones to consider are the Page Title, and META Description tags as these are (in most cases) shown whenever a webpage appears in the SERPS.

**4. Check on Your Page Load Time**
Page load time is the time your webpage takes to show up on your screen.

Google and other search engines penalise websites that load slowly. All things being equal, they will rank a faster website above a slower one.

This is also true of your visitors. If they experience a slow webpage they will leave your website, and bounce back to the SERPs to find your competitors. You’ve lost a lead and/or sale. They will probably never visit your website again.

**5.Make Your Website Responsive**
Responsive website design is the process of ensuring your website offers the same user experience when viewed on different screen sizes and devices.

Your website resizes itself depending on the type of device it is being viewed on, such as a desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones.
